    "description":"**__1) Be polite and respectful of other users__**\nWe want everyone to feel welcome. Everyone has insecurities and weaknesses, and we want to be accepting of everyone. Do not harass, be rude, or troll people. If someone feels like what you are doing is wrong, then please refrain from doing it. Additionally, don\u2019t insult other people\u2019s waifus\/husbandos. We get it, waifu wars are fun. But if it starts causing disruptions or offending people, the <@&533095365973508096> will not hesitate to enforce the rules.\n\n**__2) Please speak English__**\nConversations should be held in English. This is not because English is the best language, but because it is most commonly spoken on Discord and we want everyone to be able to participate in conversations. Memes and other similar things are fine.\n\n**__3) Don't spam__**\nThis includes emote spam, text spam, and bot spam outside of specific channels. Please keep <@172002275412279296> and <@185476724627210241> bot spam in <#398191639488757770> or kept to a minimum, and everything else in <#439593890505424896>. This also includes advertising, be it other servers, streams, or whatever. It can also mean leaving and rejoining the server repeatedly without reason. Exceptions may be made if you ask an online staff member first.\n\n**__4) No promoting illegal activities__**\nWe do not condone activities such as drug use, rape, or anything else against the law. This includes pirating anime, though discussion on that topic is not banned. Linking to torrents and streaming sites however is not allowed. \n\n**__5) Political content is only allowed in <#563009377234321408>__**\nAs interesting as it is, politics is a very controversial topic. This can lead to offensive comments being made, arguments among members, etc. Please keep any political discussion in <#563009377234321408>.",
